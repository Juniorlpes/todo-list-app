# Todo List App

This is a Flutter project to exemplify my clean [architecture proposal](https://github.com/Juniorlpes/architecture-proposal)

## Getting Started

This Todo List has three branchs/version: <br />
1 - Local data storage (Offline mode) <br />
2 - With Auth option and Firestore sdk to store and access data <br />
3 - Data access from a API Rest <br />

This is a simple basic app to show a little of how I work. 
Maybe in the future I could put more features...
